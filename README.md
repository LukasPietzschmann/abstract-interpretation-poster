# Building an Abstract Interpretation Module for _flowR_

This repo contains a poster about my work on an abstract interpretation module for the R program slicer _flowR_. To see other cool posters and presentations with, for, and about _flowR_, check out [this repo](https://github.com/Code-Inspect/flowr-presentations).

## Build it
1. You need to clone using the `--recursive` switch
2. Navigate into `2324-wt/abstract-interpretation/interim`
3. Just call `latexmk` on the `poster.tex` file
